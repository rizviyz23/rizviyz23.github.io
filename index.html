          <h2>The Fun Physics behind Roller Coasters!</h2>
            <p>Roller coasters use basic ideas from physics and engineering to create fast, exciting, and carefully controlled motion. In this post, I break down how concepts like energy, speed, acceleration, and forces work together to produce the twists, turns, and drops we experience on a ride. 
             By understanding these principles, we will see how real-world physics shapes the design and safety of every roller coaster. If you enjoy these rides, this one is for you!</p><p> But for those who don't...I hope that after you give this a read, you grow a fonder appreciation for the science. It may still be intimidating or even anxiety-inducing for you, but this blog will have you see these coasters differently- with ample respect behind the amount of thought and expertise in their fun-filled safety design. Hey, maybe this blog is enough to convince you to face your fear!</p>

          <h2>What is the best animated movie from the 2000s?
          </h2>
           <p>In this podcast, we will dive into our childhoods discovering what movie meant the most to us growing up, and why it still holds a special place in our hearts today.
           Let's revisit the characters we talked about nonstop and the soundtracks that still hit harder than they should by taking you on a nostalgia-fueled ride through the movies that defined the 2000s era.</p>

          <h2><i>The Beauty of Slow Shutter</i> - Motion Blur and Slow Shutter Techniques using Dazz Cam!</h2>
          <p>The Beauty of Slow Shutter is <i>exactly</i> what this is about. I want you to appreciate the beauty behind every intentional move behind videography, starting with slow shutter. This is for beginners- for those who want to get used to photography on portable apps on their phone! I demonstrate the most essential part of photography and videography- motion blur. My tutorial uses slow shutter on Dazz Cam to create this effect, taking you on a straight-to-the point, captivating venture. </p><p>Well..... why Dazz Cam anyways? It is free, versatile, flexible, and an extremely high-quality photography app, and many users have timelessly conveyed their appreciation for it. We will start with understanding simple buttons on Dazz Cam, adjusting ISO and speed levels, and getting a grasp on noise, exposure, and frames per second. In the end of my tutorial, we will also see some other super cool motion blur results! </p>
